## 🔑 API Setup

### 🖼️ Frontend (Flutter)

For the Flutter frontend to work with AI and backend features, you must set your API keys and backend endpoints:

- Open `lib/api/api.dart` or the relevant config files.
- Add your API keys (e.g., for Gemini, Firebase, etc.).
- Set your backend URLs as needed.

### 🛠️ Backend (Node.js)

For the backend to connect to databases, cloud services, or external APIs:

- Open `aiinsights_backend/config/` and review files like `db.js` and `schema.js`.
- Set your database connection strings, API keys, and any other required environment variables.
- You may use a `.env` file for sensitive configuration (make sure to add `.env` to `.gitignore`).
